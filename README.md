# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction ðŸ’¡ðŸ’°

This project uses regression analysis to predict medical insurance charges based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and model building using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict insurance charges using patient data.
- **Dataset**: Medical cost personal dataset (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, charges).
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- ðŸ©º Smoking status and BMI are strong predictors of higher charges.
- ðŸ“Š Visual patterns clearly show charge variation by age and smoker status.
- ðŸ§  Regression models (Linear, Random Forest) used for accurate prediction.
